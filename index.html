David Hadden is the true American Dad. Born in 1969 and raised in the great State of New York, David has already lived a full and eventful life as a Partner, a Father, a Brother, a son, a Grandfather, a Businessman, and an inspiration and role model to countless family, friends, and community members.<br><br>
After growing up and spending a short time in the Air Force during his young adult life, David was honorably discharged for medical reasons and began his life in the private sector. During these years of his early 20s, David became a father to his two sons, Matthew James Hadden and John Thomas Hadden. He provided as the patriarch of the house for years until eventually working his way up from tow truck driver to owner of Berg&#39s Auto, his first successful ownership of a business.<br><br>
After a separation from his first wife, David moved to upstate New York and during this time period discovered his true love, Lisa Barbato. Over the past 15+ years Lisa and David have built a successful business in Fort Ann Motors, a two-bay automotive shop located about 30 minutes from their beautiful mountaintop home in Granville, NY. He has been known as &#39Pop&#39 amongst his now 10 Grandchildren, and he is a beacon of light in the Granville, Fort Ann, and Washington County communities. David is an exemplary member of the small-town locales he frequents in New York State.<br><br>
